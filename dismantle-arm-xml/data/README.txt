* ./ISA_v85A_AArch32_xml_00bet9

Entire ISA specification for AArch32, including A32 and T32.

* ./ISA_uboot_req

A subset of the above, with (roughly) only the instructions required
in order to disassemble the u-boot binary.

* ./Parsed/arm_instrs.sexpr

The parsed asl instructions (output from the asl-parser). This is used
to generate a mapping from the opcodes in the XML specification to
those defined in the ASL.
